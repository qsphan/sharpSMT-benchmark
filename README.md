# Benchmarks for Model Counting Modulo The Theory of Bit-vector

There benchmarks are path conditions (PCs) gathered by Symbolic PathFinder.
  - ModMulBigInteger: generated from the Modulo Multiplication program in Gabfeed1. 
  - ModPowlBigInteger: generated from the Modulo Exponentiation program in Gabfeed1.
  - ModPowReduction: generated from another Modulo Exponenation program in [our paper]. Different from other benchmarks, each file is a set of PCs, by changing the assertion for the PCs in a file, you can obtain a new benchmark.
